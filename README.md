# Pinecone VectorDB and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This project uses "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" to test the RAG pipeline, demonstrating its superior ability to handle complex questions over standard QA models. The dataset's unique content makes it ideal for evaluating the pipeline's performance. 

The RAG pipeline consistently outperformed standard QA models by providing accurate, context-aware responses. By grounding answers in relevant contexts from the dataset, the RAG approach effectively handles intricate queries, reducing errors and demonstrating its reliability and precision.
